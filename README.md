1.	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The first thing to ensure to start designing the software is reading through the client requirement.
 I have gained knowledge about opengl before. I have never used opengl and now I have knowledge as well I learn how to add texture.
There are several stages and some of them are analyzing the requirement, creating system architecture diagrams.
 I think I could add every tactic I learn in this course and some of them are providing a structured and efficient approach to solving complex problems as well I learned
 how to create designs that are adaptable to changing requirements.

3.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

Some of the strategies I used was the utilization of old codes and I just added and took away any codes I didn’t needed
 the iteration played a big role first I made sure to create a prototype so I can test the feasibility of the 3D rendering engine, I as well I iterated through multiple versions.
 I added more stuff little by little.  Throughout the milestones I made sure to change things little by little which it helped with ensuring I was doing a good job.

4.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I think graphic and visualization can give me knowledge so I can apply it into my future educational path by enhancing my understanding in opengl and optimizing and rendering the pipeline
and the way I can use it in my future professional pathway is by obtaining knowledge on how to create2d and realistic 3d visualization.
